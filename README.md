# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 12 [PHP 2], Project 2 [Travel]
You have been provided with two files: a page that will eventually contain thumbnails
for a variety of travel images (list.php) and a page that will eventually display
the details of a single travel image (detail.php). Clicking a thumbnail in the first file
will take you to the second page where you will be able to see details for that image,
as shown in Figure 12.16.
